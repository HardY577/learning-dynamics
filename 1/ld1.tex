\begin{exercise}{2} Which social dilemma?
\end{exercise}

For player A, each social dilemma has an equal probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ of being played. Player A does not know and which game will be play and has to choose a strategy in the set $\{C, D \}$ . 

On the other hand, Player B knows in advance in which game he will be playing and had to choose a strategy in $\{C, D \}$ for every game, resulting in strategy in the set $\{ CCC, CDC, CCD, ... \} $

Let's modelize this uncertain environment to find the best strategy for each player in response to the other one.

\subsubsection{Player A}

To find the best response of player A to a strategy of player B, let's find the payoff of player A for every strategy of Player B. For that we will give the details for some computation and a table for all the result. Like in the slides, red means best strategy.


\subsubsection{Player B}

To find the best response of player B to a strategy of player A, let's find the payoff of player B for every strategy of Player A.



The response that will be best for Player B if A choose $C$ is ${CCD}$ and $DDC$ if player A choose $D$. 


\textbf{When matching the result we find that there is two Nash equilibras :$(C - DCD)$ and $(D - DDC)$ }
